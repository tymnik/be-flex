            <p>Hello everyone - welcome to my website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Anastasia and I am a gymnastics coach.</p>
            <p>Now I want to tell you about myself and my experience.<span class="ellipsis">...</span></p>

            <p>
                I have taught kids gymnastics for more than 7 years. My coaching career
                started when I was 16 years old. From that time until now I have been so
                happy to choose this job and enjoy it. Now I am 23 years old and from
                these 7 years of coaching, I have worked in a lot of different countries:
                Ukraine, Turkey, Kuwait, and Dubai.</p>
            <p>Nowadays I am working in Dubai since
                2021 and I like this place, gym and opportunities that I have here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I work
                with different ages of kids starting from 4 years old. Also, I have my
                competition girls with them we visit a lot of competition places in
                Dubai, Abu-Dhabi, and other cities and they get a lot of medals and
                trophies.
